When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If you want to backup your code and for working outside.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- If you collaborate with other people, you don't want them to see it every change. So pulling manually is safe.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- 	If you want to copy other github repository to your own, you can use forks to do that.
	If you want to copy other github repository to your local repository, you can use clone to do that.
	If you want to try something but don't want to ruin the original code, you can use branch.
